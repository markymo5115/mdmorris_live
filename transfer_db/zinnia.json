Alpha being the start of the Greek alphabet and omega being the end, the message being that God transcends time. I didn&#39;t want to overshadow the symbols so I wasn&#39;t too sure about the background to the omega. On paper I&#39;ve put a design which is based on a reference from the book, shown below the next image:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"original design up close\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/design_up_close.JPG\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>the green and white Fleur-de-lis with green cross-pattern here:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"background pattern for inspiration\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/background_pattern_inspiration.JPG\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I did a quick sample to test how it would look just focusing on the centre of the circular section:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"omega test piece drawn out\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/omega_drawn_out.JPG\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s a shot of the engraving in action, I&#39;ve found old Marigold gloves quite useful for protecting against sore fingers!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"engraving with marigolds\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/engraving_with_marigolds.JPG\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s the finished sample, with some blackening in the recesses to pick out the design:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"omega test piece finished\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/omega_test_finished.JPG\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Putting the sample next to the section piece I&#39;m pretty sure it would make the section look too busy.

I wanted it to blend in with the background blue but also pick out the white on the lower left and right&nbsp;(as seen when the cross is upright) fluer-de-lis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s some photos of the enamelling stages from where I left off on the previous posts in <a href=\"http://www.mdmorris.co.uk/blog/item/58-enamel-cross-project-part-3\" target=\"_self\">part 3</a> (it&#39;s very similar to what I did in <a href=\"http://www.mdmorris.co.uk/blog/item/59-enamel-cross-project-part-4\" target=\"_self\">part 4</a>):</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"middle section engraved and before the enamelling\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/middle_section_enamelling_1.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each layer of enamel goes on via wet laying, so I mix the enamel powder with water and apply it to the metal. After the first layer is applied, and before firing, it looks like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"middle section before the first firing\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/middle_section_enamelling_5.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The piece is placed onto a kiln trivet and fired at a little above 800 degrees C so that, when the mass of metal absorbs the heat, the kiln temperature settles down at 800 degrees. I fire it for about 2.5 minutes, although sometimes 3 minutes if the kiln has not had time to soak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"putting the piece into the kiln\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/putting_in_the_kiln.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the piece after it&#39;s been fired and cooled down:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"out of the kiln and cooled down\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/out_of_the_kiln_and_cooled_down.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I put a couple of layers of counter enamel onto the back at this stage to help minimise any bowing of the piece. My mix of scrap enamel is still giving a battleship grey!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"counter enamel on the back of the middle section\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/middle_section_counter_enamel.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After this I built up the enamel in all the recesses and started to create some of the blending of colours. The colour blends need to be established at a reasonable depth below the top surface of the final finish so that the colours don&#39;t burn out due to a thin layer. This is especially true with reds which tend to burn to a gray if they&#39;re not physically massive enough. I&#39;m also going to grind back the top surface at the end so the colour scheme needs to be at least as deep as the maximum grinding depth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn&#39;t take many photos of the intermediate steps but I think there were about a dozen firings in all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s me adding extra enamel to some of the narrow blue sections and the red border, both of which were a bit tricky to get the enamel to flow into all the narrow spaces</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"applying enamel to the middle section of the enamel cross\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/middle_section_enamelling_application.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I just thought I&#39;d show this next bit as I find it quite interesting, when the piece comes out of the kiln the enamel colours are never the same as they will be when they cool down. The heat shows off a completely different colour scheme that can sometimes be quite inspirational, it&#39;s worth having a camera handy! Take a look at this, taken after the piece is nearly finished and just out of the kiln:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"just out of the kiln and the different colours\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/just_out_of_kiln.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main blue of the cross has turned turquoise and the flowers in the middle, orange!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s important to make sure the enamel has fully filled all the recesses in the metal. For this I tend to over-fill and then grind back and re-fire. It can look rather scrappy at this stage even though it&#39;s nearly done!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"middle section with enough enamel and ready to grind back\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/middle_section_before_grinding_back_enamel.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grinding back</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"grinding back the enamel and metal to a flat surface\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/grinding_back.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After grinding I wash the piece with a toothbrush and then a glass brush just to be sure all the little bits of ground enamel and metal are cleaned away. This is what it looks like after the final grind back but before the final firing, you can see the enamel is matt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"enamel after grinding back is matt\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/middle_section_after_grinding_back.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think I must have added some more red to the roses so the previous picture was probably not the final grind back after all! I tend to grind the piece back, gently, a few times before the final time in order to get a good idea how the colours are coming along. I&#39;m pretty sure this next photo is after the final firing:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"middle section after the final firing and before polishing\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/middle_section_after_the_final_firing.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next stage is a polish with wet pumice and jeweler&#39;s rouge. Here&#39;s the pumice polishing in action:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"polishing with pumice messy messy messy!\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/polishing_with_pumice.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s quite messy!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As before I&#39;ve set the piece into plastic to minimize any radii that maybe created by the polishing wheel. After a while I found this set-up a bit tricky and took the piece out of the plastic but made sure the wheel was moving <em>away</em> from the edge and not <em>into</em> the edge of the piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s what it looks like after polishing with rouge and cleaning up:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"middle section after polishing and cleaning up\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/middle_section_after_polishing.jpg\" /></p>", "lead": "<p>The enamel cross project is coming along well.

I took plenty of photos along the way, so see below if you&#39;d like to read on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting the bottom section I&#39;d engraved in the previous part I, first, cleaned and degreased it. Then I added some washed opaque powdered enamel to the differnent sections of the piece by wet laying. I started with the blue (<a href=\"https://www.milton-bridge.co.uk/products/jewellery-enamel/milton-bridge-lead-free\" target=\"_blank\">Milton Bridge</a> Lapis Blue O128)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"applying enamel to the bottom section of the enamel cross\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/appling_enamel_to_bottom_section.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"first coat of blue enamel applied\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/first_coat_of_blue_enamel_applied.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The blue&#39;s all done, now apply the red around the border</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"red border enamel applied\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/red_border_enamel_applied.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now the flower, I need to have a mix of white, red and pink for the petals so I&#39;ve started here with the white to build up the sections. The background for the flower is opaque black.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"rose flower colour applied\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/flower_enamel_applied.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The six fluer-de-lis and it&#39;s ready for it&#39;s first firing - all the surface area in the recesses is covered with enamel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"fluer de lis colour applied\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/scroll_flower_enamel_applied.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s how it looks after the first firing, and cooled for a bit. The exposed gilding metal has oxidised in the kiln and will need to be cleaned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"after the first firing\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/after_the_first_firing.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The piece is pickled in a hot bath of sulphric acid and, in this case, cleaned with an abrasive to reveal the yellow gilding metal. I used the abrasive to bring back the metal colour so I could select the enamel colours appropriately as I go. With some firings I won&#39;t use the abrasive as it&#39;s not necessary once I know what colours I&#39;m using. So here&#39;s how it looks at this stage:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"after the second firing\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/after_second_firing_and_cleanup.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I did a check to see if the piece still fits with the next section, it does! So far so good!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"check if it still fits\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/check_in_still_fits.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s after the next layer of enamel</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"bottom section next layer of enamel\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/bottom_section_next_layer_of_enamel.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fired and check again, still OK!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"check if it still fits again!\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/check_it_still_fits_again.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grind back again as I still need to see the colour of the metal to get the overall feeling for the colour scheme. I set the piece into to plastic-wax to protect the edges from getting a radius during this procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"bottom section grinding flat\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/bottom_section_grinding_to_flat.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a few more firings this is how it looks after it comes out kiln and then out of the acid bath. Pretty manky! Ughh. The red is probably copper oxide. The sulphuric acid takes a long time to disolve the red copper oxides. The black copper oxides are dissolved pretty quickly. It should look fine once it&#39;s all ground back again - errr hopefully anyhow!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"bottom section after a few more layers of enamel\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/bottom_section_after_a_few_more_layers.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before grinding back, however, I noticed the piece was bowing. I was surprised since I&#39;m using 4mm thick gilding metal so I thought this would be enough to resist the forces the enamel exerts. However I had engraved quite a lot of metal off the top so reducing the thickness. Anyway, whatever the reason, I counter enamelled the back of the piece to try and balance the forces. For this I use my pot of random bits of enamel powder which, at the moment, comes out in battleship grey:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"bottom section counter enamel\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/bottom_section-counter_enamel.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back to cleaning up the piece</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"grinding back and preserving the edges\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/bottom_section_grinding_back_preserve_edges.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is cleaned up enough to see the design, I haven&#39;t completely ground the metal back to yellow as you can see some of the gilding metal is red. This, I believe, is due to a reduction gilding of the metal. The zinc in the metal is more volatile than the copper and so escapes from the surface of the metal during firing. This leaves a layer of copper on the surface of the gilding metal. I may be quite wrong mind you!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the enamel, built up in the recesses, are nearly flush with the surface of the metal so almost there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"bottom section showing matt enamel\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/bottom_section_matt_enamel.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s after the final firing. Before firing I&#39;d made sure all the enamel is flush with the surface and ground back to clean up all the enamel-metal interfaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"bottom section last firing\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/bottom_section_last_firing.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I set the piece into plastic-wax again and polished with wet pumice on a slow felt wheel. This gives the metal a satin finish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"bottom section after pumice polish\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/bottom_section_after_pumice.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also polished a bit more with jeweler&#39;s rouge. I could do more here but I think it&#39;s adequate for now, when all the pieces are done I&#39;ll need to polish them all at the same time to make them all coincide with each other. The gilding metal tarnishes over time and the whole finished piece needs to be consistent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"bottom section after polishing with jeweller's rouge\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/bottom_section_after_rouge_polish.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After cleaning off the excess rouge I come to this, my first finished piece!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"the finished bottom section\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/finished_bottom_section.jpg\" /></p>", "lead": "<p>This is the fourth part of my enamel cross project, for the previous part see <a href=\"http://www.mdmorris.co.uk/blog/item/58-enamel-cross-project-part-3\" target=\"_self\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve just finished the lower section of the cross, here&#39;s how it looks now:</p>", "excerpt": "blah blah", "featured": false, "tags": "enamel, medieval art, Christian art, champlev\u00e9, jeweller's rouge, pumice polishing, Milton Bridge, Milton Bridge enamels, celtic art, enamel cross, celtic", "login_required": false, "password": "", "content_template": "zinnia/_entry_detail.html", "detail_template": "entry_detail.html", "comment_enabled": false, "pingback_enabled": true, "trackback_enabled": true, "comment_count": 0, "pingback_count": 0, "trackback_count": 0, "picture": 121, "image_caption": "finished bottom section", "gallery": 3, "sites": [1], "related": [], "authors": [1], "categories": [10, 2, 1]}}, {"model": "zinnia.entry", "pk": 10, "fields": {"title": "Enamel Cross Project (part 3)", "slug": "enamel-cross-project-part-3", "status": 2, "publication_date": "2015-12-10T18:00:00Z", "start_publication": null, "end_publication": null, "creation_date": "2017-11-25T07:12:35.403Z", "last_update": "2017-12-01T12:50:49.108Z", "content": "<p>Here&#39;s the stem and base part of the cross with the engraving part complete.

I found getting a clean cut on the insides of curves to be very tricky. Somehow I managed it but couldn&#39;t really tell you how I did it! Most of the cutting is done with knife-shaped gravers, sometimes with a pointed bottom and sometimes flat. I try to use as large a flat bottomed knife-edged graver as possible to flatten out the recess cuts. If I were doing basse-taille enamelling technique, with transparent enamels, this would be more important to get a good relective surface off the metal to come through the enamel from behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next post will be in a couple of weeks and hopefully should show some good progress!</p>", "lead": "<p>This is the second part of my write-up on creating a 14 inch tall enamel cross.

I have the Milton Bridge British Enamels set, these are tested for application to gilding metal, which is high copper content brass (10% zinc, 90% copper). I&#39;m quite familiar with these enamels and used them to create the set of <a href=\"http://www.mdmorris.co.uk/other-work/cloisonne-door-knobs\" target=\"_self\">cloisonn&eacute; door knobs</a> last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I roughly cut out the gilding metal from 4mm plate:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"rough marking out of the section shapes before milling\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/rough_markinge_our_of_sections.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>and then, first, milled the bottom section into shape:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"lower section cut to shape\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/lower_cut_to_shape.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far so good!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"just testing it fits OK with the design\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/cross_sections_with_bottom_piece_cut_out.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ll cut out the other pieces after I&#39;ve made a bit more progress with the bottom section. The application of heat during enamelling may change the shape slightly so I may need to give a little bit of extra brass at the interface to allow me to file the piece back into shape - we&#39;ll see!</p>", "lead": "<p>I&#39;m currently doing a project to make an alter cross, roughly 14 inches tall and 8 inches wide.</p>", "excerpt": "I&#39;m currently doing a project to make an alter cross, roughly 14 inches tall and 8 inches wide.", "featured": false, "tags": "MarieMadeleine Gauthier, \u00c9maux du moyen \u00e2ge, champlev\u00e9, medieval art, medieval, enamel, enamel cross, alter piece, Milton Bridge, religious art, 12th century, Milton Bridge", "login_required": false, "password": "", "content_template": "zinnia/_entry_detail.html", "detail_template": "entry_detail.html", "comment_enabled": false, "pingback_enabled": true, "trackback_enabled": true, "comment_count": 0, "pingback_count": 0, "trackback_count": 0, "picture": 148, "image_caption": "Initial Cross Shape design from the customer", "gallery": 3, "sites": [1], "related": [], "authors": [1], "categories": [1]}}, {"model": "zinnia.entry", "pk": 13, "fields": {"title": "Experimental border crosses", "slug": "experimental-border-crosses", "status": 2, "publication_date": "2015-07-30T10:04:26Z", "start_publication": null, "end_publication": null, "creation_date": "2017-11-27T11:05:13.847Z", "last_update": "2017-12-01T12:51:09.340Z", "content": "<p>I&#39;ve been testing out how to create a border of crosses.

The shapes are quite complicated having an inter-locking jigsaw-like joint, see below. For this purpose I decided to use my CNC Sherline mill and program some tool paths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this post I&#39;ll document the centre of the cross, which is the most complicated of all the sections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wrote the program for the tool paths directly in gcode, I just don&#39;t have any CAD or CAM software! Luckily for me I know a bit of maths, so the shape sections of the cross were abstracted, mathematically, and described by a set of parameters. This way I could reference the parameters for all the pieces, ensuring all the sections were consistent. For this particular section, I ended up writing a function for doing one side and then found I could do a 90 degree coordinate rotation (that&#39;s the g10 l2 p0 x0 y0 r90 bit) and re-use the same function to do the next side, woo-hoo! I&#39;m exposing my geeky side! Here&#39;s a sample of it:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"gcode example\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/gcode_example.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The program that finally materialized follows tool paths that incrementally get closer to the final shape, here&#39;s a schematic of the tool paths where each tool pass gets 1mm closer to the final shape. In the actual routine I used 0.1mm increments but they&#39;re too close to show up in a photo, so this is just to illustrate:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"tool path diagram\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/tool_path.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cone is the location of the cutter and the lines show the path it will take.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In retrospect this program was not the best idea since the tool spends a lot of time not cutting any metal at the start of the routine, with only the inward semi-circle making any contact. A better approach would be to shave off the excess metal in straight lines first, then perhaps do the inward semi-circles next and finally finish with the routine above, but just without so many cycles. Anyway it worked but next time I think I can do better!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After checking the machine backlash, making fixing holes in line with the design, securing the blank metal piece to the milling table, making sure everything is aligned and axis zeroed etc, I ran the routine. It&#39;s always a bit nerve racking at first since, if anything is wrong, the cutter can easily crash into something. In this case I&#39;m using a 2mm diameter carbide cutter and any crash results in the cutter just snapping off...as I found out! Here&#39;s the mill in action cutting out the cross middle section:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"sherline mill cutting\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/Sherline_mill_cut1.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I used a feed rate of 300mm/min and, as mentioned above, a depth of cut of 0.1mm. The machine coped very well with this making good sized chippings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The joint between sections of the cross have a 1mm flat section in between the two semi circles. The largest cutter I could use was therefore 2mm diameter. However this still leaves a radius whereas, for the joint to fit snugly,&nbsp; I need a right-angle; so after the routine was finished I remounted the piece to cut the right-angle:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"cutting the right-angle\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/Sherline_mill_cut3.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then finished off by hand:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"filing by hand\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/fine_filing.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other sections were done in a similar way. When my camera recharges I&#39;ll put a photo of all the pieces together with a little gap in between each piece to highlight the join. Hopefully I&#39;ll remember to do that!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I did remember!

Phew! Quite a year! Hence this is the first blog post for a while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other project was to create a place for me to work, for this we plan to convert the garage into an enamelling workshop/studio.

We employed the skills of brothers Shaun and Gavin Hall, who, as a piece of sound advice, call themselves &#39;Don&#39;t Do It Yourself&#39;. Advice from which the previous owners of our house would benefit!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6th Nov 2014</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"workshop conversion stage 1\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/Stage1_20141106.jpg\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The walls have all been pressure-washed to remove the old paint and plaster. The wall insulation is going in on the neighbour-side of the workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7th Nov 2014</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"workshop conversion stage 2\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/Stage2_20141107.jpg\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The walls at the back and on the left have been covered with GRS slurry waterproofing since these back onto a hill and are, effectively, underground.

However I came across some useful tips on <a href=\"http://www.saatchionline.com\" target=\"_blank\">Saachti online</a> for photographing artwork in general, here&#39;s a summary adapted for photographing enamel paintings:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Ensure the camera lens is clean, a lint free cloth or compressed air jet can be used to clean it.</li>\r\n\t<li>Make sure the camera lens is directly facing the painting, that is, so the line of sight of the camera is normal to the surface of the painting. With the enamel box lid, it is not possible to get all of the painting facing the camera as the lid curves but aim to get the piece facing on average.</li>\r\n\t<li>Choose daylight to give the most true-to-life photograph of the work. Other types of light have their own colour and will bias the colour representation.</li>\r\n\t<li>Diffuse light is essential with enamels otherwise the surface will pick out the point light and reflect it. A bright but cloudy day is good. Also a light box can help to soften any sources of light. The light box can be closed at the front with a slit for the camera lens to poke through.</li>\r\n\t<li>Have a large window or photograph the piece outside. The light source needs to be facing the painting and not from behind.</li>\r\n\t<li>Use a low ISO number (100-200) to reduce the noise in the photograph.</li>\r\n\t<li>Have the zoom somewhere in the middle as most lenses are sharper when the zoom is not at either extreme.</li>\r\n\t<li>Have the iris somewhere in the middle too, f7 is good. Too wide and the photograph will not be as sharp. If I&#39;m taking a picture of the box in perspective then I may need to stop down more to get a greater depth of field, i.e. more things in focus.</li>\r\n\t<li>Use the shutter timer so that the camera does not wobble then stay put until the camera has taken the shot. My camera fixes it&#39;s settings before the timer starts so if I move away during the timer the light levels are no longer the ones the camera expects.</li>\r\n\t<li>When taking a picture face-on the enamel may give a reflection image of the camera. Fortunately to avoid this problem the light box I use has a small slit cut into the fabric of one side so that the camera lens can peep through. Other alternative solutions to this problem are to hide the image of the camera lens somewhere in the picture, or to use a zoom lens and place the camera far enough back so that any image reflections are very small.</li>\r\n\t<li>Oh yes, I almost forgot, use a tripod!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s some photo&#39;s of my camera and light box setup:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This shows the tripod leaning slightly against the table to get closer to the subject. The light source is from a large window to the left. I&#39;m using the camera to take this photo, but obviously during the shoot the camera sits on the tripod!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/tripod_and_light_box_distance_view.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the set up inside the light box. I&#39;m using an acrylic table to place the enamel on but I don&#39;t really need that since I&#39;m not looking for any reflections in the table surface. There is a black drape to limit the light coming from in front of the camera and to darken the background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/media/photologue/photos/photographing_enamel_box_using_tripod_and_light_box_vL07FMS.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can see the results of the set up in the image gallery for more recent work.
